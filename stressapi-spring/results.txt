Dropped Iterations: There were no dropped iterations; all iterations were successfully executed.

HTTP Request Blocked: The average time it took for HTTP requests to be blocked was approximately 2.38 microseconds. The fastest blocking event occurred in 900 nanoseconds, while the slowest took 2.32 milliseconds. The 90th percentile (p(90)) of blocking times was 3 microseconds, and the 95th percentile (p(95)) was 3.6 microseconds.

HTTP Request Connecting: The average time it took for HTTP requests to establish a connection was approximately 144 nanoseconds. The fastest connection event occurred instantly (0 nanoseconds), and the slowest took 978.1 microseconds. The 90th percentile (p(90)) for connection times was 0 nanoseconds, and the 95th percentile (p(95)) was 0 nanoseconds.

HTTP Request Duration: The average duration of HTTP requests was approximately 981.98 microseconds. The fastest request took 701.5 microseconds, while the slowest took 235.08 milliseconds. The 90th percentile (p(90)) request duration was 1.14 milliseconds, and the 95th percentile (p(95)) was 1.3 milliseconds.

HTTP Request Failed: All 67,498 HTTP requests were successful, resulting in a 100.00% success rate.

HTTP Request Receiving: The average time it took to receive an HTTP response was approximately 51.64 microseconds. The fastest response reception event occurred in 11.4 microseconds, while the slowest took 4.34 milliseconds. The 90th percentile (p(90)) for response receiving time was 69.8 microseconds, and the 95th percentile (p(95)) was 81.9 microseconds.

HTTP Request Sending: The average time it took to send an HTTP request was approximately 15.87 microseconds. The fastest request sending event occurred in 3.6 microseconds, while the slowest took 10.54 milliseconds. The 90th percentile (p(90)) for request sending time was 27.6 microseconds, and the 95th percentile (p(95)) was 30.1 microseconds.

HTTP Request TLS Handshaking: There was no measurable time spent on TLS handshaking for these requests (average, min, med, and max times were all 0).

HTTP Request Waiting: The average time spent waiting for a response after sending a request was approximately 914.47 microseconds. The shortest wait time was 670.9 microseconds, and the longest was 232.84 milliseconds. The 90th percentile (p(90)) for waiting time was 1.06 milliseconds, and the 95th percentile (p(95)) was 1.21 milliseconds.

HTTP Requests: A total of 67,498 HTTP requests were made, occurring at an average rate of approximately 749.97 requests per second.

Iteration Duration: The average duration of test iterations was approximately 2.07 milliseconds. The shortest iteration took 1.58 milliseconds, while the longest took 249.65 milliseconds. The 90th percentile (p(90)) for iteration duration was 2.41 milliseconds, and the 95th percentile (p(95)) was 2.74 milliseconds.

Iterations: A total of 33,749 test iterations were executed, occurring at an average rate of approximately 374.98 iterations per second.

VUs (Virtual Users): The number of virtual users ranged from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 3 during the test.

VUs Max (Maximum Virtual Users): The maximum number of virtual users reached and remained at 50 throughout the test.
